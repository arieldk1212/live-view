   * @todo need to change this to a concurrent environment. meaning no mutex,
   * init another connection or execute multiple times, test it, check pqxx
   docs.
   * allow multi threaded runs, connection pool??
   * FROM THE PQXX DOCS:
   * Treat a connection, together with any and all objects related to it, as a
   "world" of its own. You should generally make sure that the same "world" is
   never accessed by another thread while you're doing anything non-const in
   there.
   * Not within the same connection. Even if you use nested transactions (see
   the subtransaction class), a connection is always dealing with just one
   transaction at a time. Of course you can create a new transaction on the same
   connection once the previous one has completed. If you want to have multiple
   concurrent transactions, let them work on different connections.
   * for now consider other types of transadction, maybe when pool and
   concurrency is implemented add another features, for one 1 will do with a
   mutex thats not needed but it there.

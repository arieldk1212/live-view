#ifndef RESPONSE_H 
#define RESPONSE_H

// INFO: this class is all about the response classes from different classes across the project.
// meaning -> from db model a model returns a certain reponse from the db, due to that we will
// create a class that will handle different reponse cases and return the right response, i.e:
// virtual DBResponse WriteToDB(); -> it will hold data, codes, general info about the response.
